buying some frozen food, put it in a fridge
Turn up the music louder

Don't let it be me, don't let it be me!
Don't let it be me, don't let it be me!
Cause I'm never never never never gonna let you down
Cause I'm never never never never gonna let you down

I hope one day you'll understand
what you really meant to me

And nothing is the same no more
Since you went away
Don't let it be me, don't let it be me!

I don't care if you go away
I don't care if you wanted this

Break it up, break it up, break it up, break it up, my love
If you think that you can't stay with me then break it up my love
Break it up, just break it up, break it up, just break it up.
So where in the world, where in the world,
Where in the world can I hide this hurt,
I don't mind, I don't mind
If you call me sad, call me strong
Strong enough to make it on my own
'Cause I don't mind, I don't mind
If you tear down your walls inside
Go for a brand new ride
But babe please don't tell me so
Break it up, break it up, break it up, break it up, my love
If you think that you can't stay with me then break it up my love

Walking in the rain.
Far away from nowhere.
No more noise, just silence.
And the music that's in my brain.
Walking through the night.
A different atmosphere.
No more noise, just silence.
And the sound that's in my ear.
I'm just dancing, dancing in the moonlight.
I'm dancing, dancing in the moonlight.
Walking down the hill.
Listening to the trees.
No more noise, just silence.
And the raindrops on my shoes.
Walking down the beach.
Sprarkling lights on the water.
No more noise, just silence.
And by the way, I'm feeling free.
I'm just dancing, dancing in the moonlight.
I'm dancing, dancing in the moonlight.
I'm dancing, dancing in the moonlight.
I'm dancing, dancing in the moonlight.

Back on the mic I got the sound
Holding you down, down to the ground
Speaking the melody
Who out there gut the skills to test me?

Beats going crazy inside my head
Everything's alright

Girl of my dreams
you don't know what means
to live my life without you
I hope everyday
when you pass my way
I there to say a word to you
But everytime you look at me
I go right out of my head
And then I just turn away
and act like I don't see you
You're so far away
No reason to stay here
I live in silence
Sometimes I think
I'll win back my confidence
and be the man I used to be
But a touch of your smile
and I feel so strange again
and lose myself in the wait and see
And everytime when you are near
and act like you don't care I get so insecure
and then I'm not so sure
You're so far away
No reason to stay here

One more bad break could bring a fall
When I'm far from home
Don't call me on the phone
To tell me you're alone
It's easy to deceive
It's easy to tease
But hard to get release
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face
Yeah
I spend so much time
believing all the lies
To keep the dream alive
Now it makes me sad
It makes me mad at truth
For lovin' what was you
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage your eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage your eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face
Such a human waste your eyes without a face
And now it's getting worse
Live and direct, busy again
let there be rhythm, let there be fun
We're just warming up
to rock the groove
on our journey of sound
we gonna make you move
you know what I mean
In search for something
like the next tomorrow
I've got a suggestion and
I need you to follow
Hands up! Hands up! Hands up!
YEEE-HEEY!!
This is the voice from outer space
responsible rhythm for the human race
no return, no regret but resurrection
we shout it out loud to get a reaction
jump all up, keep it up to the top
that was then but this is now
what a wonderful day just let yourself go
Hands up! Hands up! Hands up!
YEEEEE! C'mon!

Hands up! Hands up! Hands up!
YEEEEE!! YEEEEEEEEEE!

Good evening
Put on my raving shoes and I borded the plane
Touched down in a land where the sky was blue
In the middle of the pouring rain
Everybody was happy
Energy shining down on me

I'm raving, I'm raving
I'm raving 'till the sweat has fallen down off me
I'm raving, I'm raving
But do I really feel the way I feel?
Yeah
Come on

Going back into time,
Blind through the night,
remember, when it just took all over.
Taking me higher,
thoughts in my mind,
on the roof, up lifting, and drifting away.
From city to city,
from dawn to dawn.
And the whole generation,
is on the run.
Good bye to the past, hello to the future
as the struggle continues.
There's no fate.
Someone's gonna ask you,
about the truth, and the meaning,
expecting another answer
to be sure he's on the right side
and you're on the wrong
do not listen, its your decision
from face to face, from soul to soul
and the whole generation
is out of control,
good bye to the past, hello to the future.
as the struggle continues
There's no fate
There's no fate
There's no fate
There's no fate
from city to city,
from dawn to dawn.
from face to face,
from soul to soul
as the struggle continues
There's no fate
There's no fate
I'm Your Pusher

Jetz kommt die feuerwehr
Ahh
Scootland posse
Yes
Uaahhh!
Isn't it nice
Sugar and spice
Luring disco dollies
To a life of vice
I could make a film
And make you my star
You'd be a natural the way you are
I would like you on
A long black leash
I would parade you
Down the high street
You've got the attraction
You've got the pulling power
Walk my little doggy
Walk my little sex dwarf
We could make a scene
We'd be a team
Making the headlines
Sounds like a dream
When we hit the floor
You just watch them move aside
We will take them
For a ride of rides
They all love your
Miniature ways
You know what they say
About small boys
Sex dwarf
I'm in my Jaguar
look it's so huge
It's big and it's gold
With my dumb chauffer
Looking to procure
Run my little doggy
Lure a disco dollie
Run my little sex dwarf
I feel so lonely
Get my little camera
Take a pretty picture
Sex dwarf
In a gold Rolls
Making it with the dumb chauffer
Isn't it nice
Sugar and spice
Luring disco dollies
To a life of vice
Sex dwarf
Isn't it nice
Luring disco dollies to a life of vice
Sex dwarf
We could make an outfit
For my little sex dwarf
To match the gold Rolls
And my dumb chauffer
We'll knock 'em cold
Knockin 'em cold
In black and gold
We can have playtime
In my little playroom
Disco dollies
My sex dwarf
And my dumb chauffer
I would like you on a long black leash
You can bring me all the things I need
Sex dwarf isn't it nice
Luring disco dollies to a life of vice
Sex dwarf
If I could stop the time to reach for sublime
things getting strange like up an down
if you could read my mind it's hard to find
I said I want you back but this is no regret
it's my point of view and I'm going through
so take me away just for one day
I've never seen someone like you before
in my dreams I saw you standing there
I'm going out no more since I heard the news
there's someone else you choose
I can't believe what they said
that's why I feel so bad
morning, noon and night
my thoughts run circles without any purpose
I can't stand no more - it's like circus
I want to repeat, there's nothing wrong I've done
She's the sun
If I think of the past life is so fast
those memories keep me alive and I will survive
even if I'm here and left without
is there any secret? do you think we'll keep it?
life's so strange if you know what I mean
there's no one I've seen before like you
to be honest, I didn't expect something like this
it's you I miss now and forever
you and me together
that's what we thought our life should be
I never could imagine this would happen to me
you feel better now you said it's what I cannot believe
my thoughts run circles without any purpose
I can't stand no more - it's like circus
I want to repeat, there's nothing wrong I've done
She's the sun
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
Hard like wax going up to the max
Starting up those lirycs on our radical tracks
Put on your headphones when I'm expressing lirycal
Like no other mc my concept is a miracle
When I've got the microphone I don't like the slow mo
You know my flow is better than a porno in soho
All I recommend is to be in the place
When we start jammin' up and rockin'to your face
Never slow down 
Fresh on the mic you got it tonight
We're still on the mix and we've won the fight
Here is the lyrical assault and I call it rough
Is someone's gonna blame us enough is enough
Tried of the bussines sick if all the fake hellos
People run around and while they look like marshmellows
We continue our work and we don't want repeats
'couse we know our crowd is still addicted to our bass
Never slow down 
Down to the bone down to the bone down to the bone
Down to the bone down to the bone down to the bone
Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled too
A song that I had only sang to just a few
She saw my silver spurs and said let pass some time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oohh-oh summer wine
Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oohh-oh summer wine
My eyes grew heavy and my lips they could not speak
I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
She reassured me with an unfamilliar line
And then she gave to me more summer wine
Oohh-oh summer wine
Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oohh-oh summer wine
When I woke up the sun was shining in my eyes
My silver spurs were gone my head felt twice its size
She took my silver spurs a dollar and a dime
And left me cravin' for more summer wine
Oohh-oh summer wine
Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off those silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you my summer wine
Oohh-oh summer wine
Down to the bone down to the bone down to the bone
Tyree Cooper, the producer
