Last night my little dancer, came dancing to my door.

buying some frozen food, put it in a fridge
Turn up the music louder

Thank god it's friday
You lift me up
Just to put me down
You try to bring me up up up
Confusion all around
I hear your words

Don't let it be me, don't let it be me!
Don't let it be me, don't let it be me!
Cause I'm never never never never gonna let you down
Cause I'm never never never never gonna let you down

To where you wanna be
I hope one day you'll understand
what you really meant to me
But then I'm gone

And nothing is the same no more
Since you went away
Don't let it be me, don't let it be me!

If you call me bad, call me wrong
Call me anything but your own
I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't care if you leave me
I don't care if you go away
I don't care if you wanted this
I don't mind
Break it up, break it up, break it up, break it up, my love
If you think that you can't stay with me then break it up my love
Break it up, just break it up, break it up, just break it up.
So where in the world, where in the world,
Where in the world can I hide this hurt,
I don't mind, I don't mind
If you call me sad, call me strong
Strong enough to make it on my own
'Cause I don't mind, I don't mind
If you tear down your walls inside
Go for a brand new ride
But babe please don't tell me so
Break it up, break it up, break it up, break it up, my love
If you think that you can't stay with me then break it up my love
Break it up, just break it up, break it up, just break it up.

Walking in the rain.
Far away from nowhere.
No more noise, just silence.
And the music that's in my brain.
Walking through the night.
A different atmosphere.
No more noise, just silence.
And the sound that's in my ear.
I'm just dancing, dancing in the moonlight.
I'm dancing, dancing in the moonlight.
Walking down the hill.
Listening to the trees.
No more noise, just silence.
And the raindrops on my shoes.
Walking down the beach.
Sprarkling lights on the water.
No more noise, just silence.
And by the way, I'm feeling free.
I'm just dancing, dancing in the moonlight.
I'm dancing, dancing in the moonlight.
I'm dancing, dancing in the moonlight.
I'm dancing, dancing in the moonlight.

Back on the mic I got the sound
Holding you down, down to the ground
Speaking the melody
Who out there gut the skills to test me?

Beats going crazy inside my head
Everything's alright

Girl of my dreams
you don't know what means
to live my life without you
I hope everyday
when you pass my way
I there to say a word to you
But everytime you look at me
I go right out of my head
And then I just turn away
and act like I don't see you
You're so far away
No reason to stay here
I live in silence
Sometimes I think
I'll win back my confidence
and be the man I used to be
But a touch of your smile
and I feel so strange again
and lose myself in the wait and see
And everytime when you are near
and act like you don't care I get so insecure
and then I'm not so sure
You're so far away
No reason to stay here

One more bad break could bring a fall
When I'm far from home
Don't call me on the phone
To tell me you're alone
It's easy to deceive
It's easy to tease
But hard to get release
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face
Yeah
I spend so much time
believing all the lies
To keep the dream alive
Now it makes me sad
It makes me mad at truth
For lovin' what was you
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage your eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage your eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face
Such a human waste your eyes without a face
And now it's getting worse
Live and direct, busy again
let there be rhythm, let there be fun
We're just warming up
to rock the groove
on our journey of sound
we gonna make you move
you know what I mean
In search for something
like the next tomorrow
I've got a suggestion and
I need you to follow
Hands up! Hands up! Hands up!
YEEE-HEEY!!
This is the voice from outer space
responsible rhythm for the human race
no return, no regret but resurrection
we shout it out loud to get a reaction
jump all up, keep it up to the top
that was then but this is now
what a wonderful day just let yourself go
Hands up! Hands up! Hands up!
YEEEEE! C'mon!

Good evening
Put on my raving shoes and I borded the plane
Touched down in a land where the sky was blue
In the middle of the pouring rain
Everybody was happy
Energy shining down on me

Feel as good as a boy can be
I'm raving, I'm raving
I'm raving 'till the sweat has fallen down off me
I'm raving, I'm raving
But do I really feel the way I feel?
Yeah
Come on

Going back into time,
Blind through the night,
remember, when it just took all over.
Taking me higher,
thoughts in my mind,
on the roof, up lifting, and drifting away.
From city to city,
from dawn to dawn.
And the whole generation,
is on the run.
Good bye to the past, hello to the future
as the struggle continues.
There's no fate.
Someone's gonna ask you,
about the truth, and the meaning,
expecting another answer
to be sure he's on the right side
and you're on the wrong
do not listen, its your decision
from face to face, from soul to soul
and the whole generation
is out of control,
good bye to the past, hello to the future.
as the struggle continues
There's no fate
There's no fate
There's no fate
There's no fate
from city to city,
from dawn to dawn.
from face to face,
from soul to soul
as the struggle continues
There's no fate
There's no fate
I'm Your Pusher

Ahh
Scootland posse
Yes
Uaahhh!
Isn't it nice
Sugar and spice
Luring disco dollies
To a life of vice
I could make a film
And make you my star
You'd be a natural the way you are
I would like you on
A long black leash
I would parade you
Down the high street
You've got the attraction
You've got the pulling power
Walk my little doggy
Walk my little sex dwarf
We could make a scene
We'd be a team
Making the headlines
Sounds like a dream
When we hit the floor
You just watch them move aside
We will take them
For a ride of rides
They all love your
Miniature ways
You know what they say
About small boys
Sex dwarf
I'm in my Jaguar
look it's so huge
It's big and it's gold
With my dumb chauffer
Looking to procure
Run my little doggy
Lure a disco dollie
Run my little sex dwarf
I feel so lonely
Get my little camera
Take a pretty picture
Sex dwarf
In a gold Rolls
Making it with the dumb chauffer
Isn't it nice
Sugar and spice
Luring disco dollies
To a life of vice
Sex dwarf
Isn't it nice
Luring disco dollies to a life of vice
Sex dwarf
We could make an outfit
For my little sex dwarf
To match the gold Rolls
And my dumb chauffer
We'll knock 'em cold
Knockin 'em cold
In black and gold
We can have playtime
In my little playroom
Disco dollies
My sex dwarf
And my dumb chauffer
I would like you on a long black leash
You can bring me all the things I need
Sex dwarf isn't it nice
Luring disco dollies to a life of vice
Sex dwarf
If I could stop the time to reach for sublime
things getting strange like up an down
if you could read my mind it's hard to find
I said I want you back but this is no regret
it's my point of view and I'm going through
so take me away just for one day
I've never seen someone like you before
in my dreams I saw you standing there
I'm going out no more since I heard the news
there's someone else you choose
I can't believe what they said
that's why I feel so bad
morning, noon and night
my thoughts run circles without any purpose
I can't stand no more - it's like circus
I want to repeat, there's nothing wrong I've done
She's the sun
If I think of the past life is so fast
those memories keep me alive and I will survive
even if I'm here and left without
is there any secret? do you think we'll keep it?
life's so strange if you know what I mean
there's no one I've seen before like you
to be honest, I didn't expect something like this
it's you I miss now and forever
you and me together
that's what we thought our life should be
I never could imagine this would happen to me
you feel better now you said it's what I cannot believe
my thoughts run circles without any purpose
I can't stand no more - it's like circus
I want to repeat, there's nothing wrong I've done
She's the sun
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
I'm the cowboy, the space cowboy
Hard like wax going up to the max
Starting up those lirycs on our radical tracks
Put on your headphones when I'm expressing lirycal
Like no other mc my concept is a miracle
When I've got the microphone I don't like the slow mo
You know my flow is better than a porno in soho
All I recommend is to be in the place
When we start jammin' up and rockin'to your face
Never slow down
Fresh on the mic you got it tonight
We're still on the mix and we've won the fight
Here is the lyrical assault and I call it rough
Is someone's gonna blame us enough is enough
Tried of the bussines sick if all the fake hellos
People run around and while they look like marshmellows
We continue our work and we don't want repeats
'couse we know our crowd is still addicted to our bass
Never slow down
Down to the bone down to the bone down to the bone
Down to the bone down to the bone down to the bone
Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled too
A song that I had only sang to just a few
She saw my silver spurs and said let pass some time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oohh-oh summer wine
Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oohh-oh summer wine
My eyes grew heavy and my lips they could not speak
I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
She reassured me with an unfamilliar line
And then she gave to me more summer wine
Oohh-oh summer wine
Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oohh-oh summer wine
When I woke up the sun was shining in my eyes
My silver spurs were gone my head felt twice its size
She took my silver spurs a dollar and a dime
And left me cravin' for more summer wine
Oohh-oh summer wine
Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off those silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you my summer wine
Oohh-oh summer wine
Down to the bone down to the bone down to the bone

Ice, the mad rhymer
The pitch shifter

I'm back, cating a soljah flex
Bop down with my Avirex
As I wreck, check, recollect in full effect
Along with a phat chain 'round my neck
A stink mentality, I couldn't care less
Now let me know if you're good to go
I say
Hello! Hello! Good to be back, good to be back
Hello! Hello! Good to be back, good to be back
Hello! Hello! Good to be back, good to be back
Hello! Hello! Good to be back, good to be back
Gonna chat on the mic to the E.N.D.

Don't stop it's the ride of your life
Hold on tight, the whole night, 'cause you got the right
Now let me know if you're good to go
I say
Hello! Hello! Good to be back, good to be back
Hello! Hello! Good to be back, good to be back
Hello! Hello! Good to be back, good to be back

Hello! Hello! Good to be back, good to be back
Hello! Hello! Good to be back, good to be back
Hello! Hello! Good to be back, good to be back

The Explosion off my tongue makes you shiver
makes your heart go numb
you're on the run
you faggot lost your flavour like an old piece of gum yeah
it's tragic the fact when I damage
so you can't manage to rap
just manage to panic
put the pen to the pad and see your
talent vanish
rambling wack shit try to show you're the baddest
while I sit back and relax go in full flow with attacks
Know you're an act
your styles showing the cracks
for a fact you couldn't spit this
privileged to witness
Giant steps are what you take
Walking on the moon
I hope my legs don't break
Walking on the moon
We could walk forever
Walking on the moon
We could live together
Walking on, walking on the moon
I'm doing my shit, you'll be eyeing my riches
spilt your lips, if you were half the man your bitch is
leave you there with stitches, jacking to the pictures
of your sister, 'til your hands got blisters
while I sit back and relax, go in full flow
with attacks
Know you're an act
your styles showing the cracks
for a fact you couldn't spit this
privileged to witness
I don't speak my rhymes
I speak my mind
I battle with closed eyes
and start beefing blind
Giant steps are what you take
Walking on the moon
I hope my legs don't break
Walking on the moon
We could walk forever
Walking on the moon
We could live together
Walking on, walking on the moon
I flick the switch
2000 Volts of lyrical tricks yeah
Discharge hard like lightning quick and
Hear the tick you got it?
But before you hear the tock
There's a new flex I drop
From my frontal lobe
Till the microphone explodes
Love to rock bottom beats for the flicks
to hibernate and syncopate but I'm still in the mix
Come on!

U.F.O. Phenomena
Across the sky like a star,
U.F.O. Phenomena
Adamski may have gone tpp far,
U.F.O. Phenomena
On planet earth it's so bizarre
Moving with the right directive
We got the sound for those who are selective,
Yes man! Set it off with a loud bang,
Rock the set with the mic in my hand!
We kick it off with a nuff nuff clout
M.C.H set it off
'Cause I got the mouth
We are here to progress
On a mission that stands above the rest
When I rock onthe set with a P! for perfection
The set was ours at my last recollection
My young love said to me, my mother won't mind
And my father won't slight you for your lack of kind,
And she stepped away from me and this she did say,
It will not be long love 'til our wedding day
Alright, this one's going out to our posse
To all da junglist boys and girls in the place,
Yes!
Tonight! Get in line your mind and your views in order
Make them run like water!
We kick it off send ya on a brainbender
Pay attention, you're next on the agenda
We are here to progress
On a mission that stands above all the rest
Okay, if I had to choose
I'd be by myself
I wanna be in love
But with nobdoy else
To all da crew and every wench
Listen, this is Ratty's Revenge
My young love said to me, my mother don't mind
And my father won't slight you for your lack of kind
And she stepped away from me and this she did say,
It will not be long love 'til our wedding day
This one's going out
To everybody in the place
Biggin' up their chest, screwing up their face
Listening to the jungle, the jungle drum and bass
Gonna get your karma when you're old and grey
If you see this music here to stay
This is what I wanna say:
Drum and bass and jungle will never die
To all the girls and guys who like to drink and get high
Wanna do the best that the money can buy
Hook me up with the shit that killed Elvis
Hook me up with the shit that killed Elvis
Hook me up with the shit that killed Elvis
Hook me up with the shit that killed Elvis
Hold on, wait a minute!
I'm on the mic, get with it!
In it to win it, gonna take you outta limits
I set it come on set it, kick and smash it
Gonna chant any music with a gimmick with the lyric
Come on here's the place to be
And she got a taste of me
Whether doggy style or whether facing me
Looking for a good time? I'm the guy to see
Too much of me will never make you O.D.
Hook me up with the shit that killed Elvis
Hook me up with the shit that killed Elvis
Hook me up with the shit that killed Elvis
Hook me up with the shit that killed Elvis
This one is a battle for U and I
If you wanna see the greatest M.C.
All you have to do is watching me
You told me you were heavyweight
You're just as light as a feather!
If I see you I'll switch
I'm not a nice fella!
Your last release was anything but a seller
And your microphone fears the word accapella!
On the elevator to the top of the papercase
Face to face writing rhymes and communicate
I'm motivated, incredible highly elevated
Smooth in the mind and more sophisticated
You told me you were heavyweight
You're just as light as a feather!
If I see you I'll switch
I'm not a nice fella!
Your last release was anything but a seller
And your microphone fears the word accapella!
Here we go again!
The rudeboy, kind of hardcore is back in town
The futuristic entertainer
The stage is my arena
I step on toes when I flow
Don't get offended
And get with it when I kick it
And comprehend it
This is one, a what I call pitchback
It will be a pitchblack
M.C.s better fix up your head
Write some proper rap
No say you're wack
I'll check, horseman's back
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
He once was a true love of mine
I lose my mind when i chat
I'm gonna bring it back
I'll be sharp like a razor, no stargazer
Like a train on a track
This a one, a what the mic controller
An ease roller
Used to be an oldschool skater,
The chicks terminator
Now four years later
The new style gladiator
Lock and load
I is gonna drop the bomb
Big up the hardcore posse
Mad props going out the mad crew junglists
Hear me now
Increase the peace
Spread the love
Swallow back, here is a track just for you
Featuring Notorious Dave and his crew
Hop da spot, rock round da clock
U can't reach my calibre, my lyrical stamina
Magical like excliber, that's how it goes
That's the prose
And if you dunno you have to be
Uno, dos tres at least one of the best
Big up them junglist boys, I say yes
Hyping up the crowd
All those lyrics flowing out of my mouth
Coming at ya like Cleopatra!
This is the place, stand up
Right now!
Check it!

Einmal wissen dieses bleibt für immer
Ist nicht Rausch der schon die Nacht verklagt
Ist nicht Farbenschmelz noch Kerzenschimmer
Von dem Grau des Morgen langst verjagt
Einmal fassen tief im Blute fühlen
Dies ist mein und es ist nur durch Dich
Nicht die Stirne mehr am Fenster kühlen
Dran ein Nebel schwer vorüber strich
Einmal fassen tief im Blute fühlen
Dies ist mein und es ist nur durch Dich
Klagt ein Vogel ach auch mein Gefieder
Näßt der Regen flieg ich durch die Welt
Jumping is an ability
That most humans and many animals share to some degree
It is the process of getting one's body off the ground for a short time using only one's own power
Usually by propelling oneself upward via contraction
And then force for extension of the legs
In some cases the height of the jump may be increased by using a trampoline
Or by pushing down with the arms when playing leap frog
One can jump up to reach something high
Jump over a fence or ditch or jump down
And one can jump while dancing and as a sport..
But jump also is the synonym for an exciting style of dancing
Just to freak out for some time
Now listen to the sounds of Rick, Michael and The Chicks Terminator
Please, Jump!

In this cruel place your voice above the maelstrom
In the wake of this ship of fools I'm falling further down
If you can see me, Marian, reach out and take me home
I hear you calling Marian
Across the water, across the wave
I hear you calling Marian
Can you hear me calling you to
Save me, save me, save me from the
Grave..
Marian
Marian, there's a weight above me
And the pressure is all too strong
To breathe deep
Breathe long and hard
To take the water down and go to sleep
To sink still further
Beneath the fatal wave
Marian I think I'm drowning
This sea is killing me
I hear you calling Marian
Across the water, across the wave
I hear you calling Marian
Can you hear me calling you to
Save me, save me, save me from the
Grave..
Marian
Was ich kann und was ich könnte
Weiss ich gar nicht mehr
Gib mir wieder etwas schönes
Zieh mich aus dem meer
Ich höre dich rufen Marian
Kannst du mich schreien hören
Ich bin hier allein
Ich höre dich rufen Marian
Ohne deine hilfe verliere ich mich in diesem ort
Marian, there's a weight above me
And the pressure is all too strong
To breathe deep
Breathe long and hard
To take the water down and go to sleep
To sink still further
Beneath the fatal wave
Marian I think I'm drowning
This sea is killing me
Marian

What happens when life breaks down?
When there is systemic contradiction.
My name symbolized all that was corrupt to society.
His name symbolized all that was pure.
And I was being hailed in the embrace of the man who was pure.
And these inviolable sanctities were preserved in those words:
J'adore hardcore...

I wanna see the rainbow high in the sky

Then I hope to see your smile every night and day
One cold damp evening
The world stood still
I watched as I held my breath
A silhouette I thought I knew
Came through
And someone spoke to me
Whispered in my ear
This fantasy's for you
Fantasies are "in" this year
My whole life passed before my eyes
I thought
What they say is true
I shed my skin and my disguise
And cold, numb and naked
I emerged from my cocoon
And a half remembered tune
Played softly in my head
He said
Then he turned smiling...
He turned smiling...
I realise a miracle is due
I dedicate this melody to you
I realise a miracle is due
I dedicate this melody to you
But is this the stuff dreams are made of?
If this is the stuff dreams are made of
No wonder I feel like I'm floating on air
No wonder I feel like I'm floating on air
I realise a miracle is due
I dedicate this melody to all of you
But is this the stuff dreams are made of?
If this is the stuff dreams are made of
No wonder I feel like I'm floating on air
No wonder I feel like I'm floating on air
No wonder I feel like I'm floating on air
Floating on air...
And it feels like I'm everywhere
It's like you fail to make the connection
You know how vital it is
(someone's banging on my door)
Or when something slips through your fingers
You know how precious it is
(someone's banging on my door)
Well you reach the point where you know
It's only your second skin
It's only your second skin
It's only your second skin
Stuck on you
I got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way,
Mighty glad you stayed
Alright now, come on!
Gotta live for the moment, everyone could be the last
Might be no tomorrow, might be no past
Too fast things will change, what you never expect when it's getting strange

He say, she say turn the tune to replay, it's time and today got big like a DJ
He say, she say turn the tune to replay , try it today - in a different way, yeah

So play this tune in your town
Rough when I rock the mic not enough got the stuff
I'm eccentric, my body's electric
Ecstatic, energetic, bold and proud
Yeeah..., when you're down on the floor
Can you shout out loud
Like you got the score!
Dreams are my reality
The only kind of real fantasy
Illusions are a common thing
I try to live in dreams
It seems as if it's meant to be
It's big and bigger, I'm quick on the trigger
Fresh bars right I'm going to deliver
Lyrical, miracle, empirical dictator
Words so clear, I don't need a translator
I'm the pre-storm silence
Thunder is coming
Get in line your mind
When the bass drum is drumming
Yeeah..., when you're down on the floor
Can you shout out loud
Like you got the score!
Dreams are my reality
The only kind of real fantasy
Illusions are a common thing
I try to live in dreams
It seems as if it's meant to be

Close your eyes, just feel and realise
It is real and not a dream
I'm in you and you're in me
It is time to break the chains of life
If you follow you will see
What's beyond reality
One, two, three, four, five, let's ride
All the crew walk side by side
Kick another bar, so alive
Lyrical twist with a lemon and lime
Coming on the mic, provide the vibe
Coming on the mic, provide the vibe
It's not where you take things from
It's where you take them to
Close your eyes, just feel and realise
It is real and not a dream
I'm in you and you're in me
It is time to break the chains of life

Comin' and movin' and rocking like a rebel
Another lyric like a bullet from a gun
Another twist with the mc number one
Another level, carry on like a rebel

Winning every battle and never get a medal

Thank you
Walking out in the street at midnight
Whispering wind catch me in the headlight
Talk about your life I'd like to know
It's not easy – going where no one goes
And no one knows
When I say daze my name, my flow is cause for pain
But also sicker than your own domain
Come with me, I'm still insane
Still insane in the membrane
A man likes milk and now he owns a million cows
We love to party, that's why we rock the house
Join the crowd and kill the lights
Hands are waving throughout the night
Walking out in the street at midnight
Whispering wind catch me in the headlight
Talk about your life I'd like to know
It's not easy – going where no one goes
And no one knows
I try to keep calm and carry on
Life's so fast like you're on the run
And tell the cook the fish was shit
Now let's do it like a club sandwich
I can be the bun and you can be the burger girl
Come and join the crew, we're living in another world
Lessons are written in the sands of time
I tried to learn but I won't change my mind
Yeah
Talk about your life I'd like to know
It's not easy – going where no one goes
And no one knows
